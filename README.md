# Steps-First
A minimal clockface for Fitbit Sense that is centered around steps

In this repo, you can find the source code as well as the exported .fba to use directly in Fitbit Sense or Versa 3.

As per the image, the steps counter on the upper left changes to per 250 when the user has done less than 250 steps in an hour.
This is to help the user know if they have to walk directly by looking at the clockface, without the need to search anywhere else.
If the divider is not apparent, it means that the user has already walked more than 250 steps in the last hour, and the total number of steps for the day is visible.
