# Steps-First
A minimal clockface for Fitbit Sense that is centered around steps

In this repo, you can find the source code as well as the exported .fba to use directly in Fitbit Sense or Versa 3.

As per the image, the steps counter on the upper-right; changes to steps/250, when the user has walked less than 250 steps in this hour.

This is to help the user know if they have to walk more, by looking directly at the clockface, without the need to search anywhere else.
If the divider is not apparent, it means that the user has already walked more than 250 steps in the last hour, and the total number of steps for the day is visible.

Languages supported: English, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, German

Fitbit SDK: 6.0

Tested on Fitbit Sense
